									<p>I'm a passionate mechanical engineer who enjoys learning new skills and working on fun projects, whether for myself or friends. After graduating from university, I spent almost a year backpacking around the world and meeting some amazing people along the way. Now, I'm working at an industrial water treatment company that specializes in clean-tech.</p>
									<p> I made this website for 2 reasons:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>To have a binder that I can look back on for the projects I've worked on along the way.</li>
											<li>To teach myself how to code a website, figuring those skills might come in handy someday.</li>
										</ol>
									<p>
										I spent a few weeks diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, and, like all my projects, this site is a constant work in progress. While Iâ€™m not aiming to be a frontend software engineer, I think knowing a bit about web development is at the very least, a pretty cool skill to have.
